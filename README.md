# CHpredict

Trying to predict the phase_class of each area using conflict, market and climate data.  Right now it really sucks.  

A lot of work needs to go into creating the most appropriate measures from the market and conflict data

Another problem is the incomplete price data and the decisions of what level to aggregate to.

If you dont care about the data wrangling (which still needs work) the CART part is: CART.R

RIP first model
